# World Through Postcards

A page to showcase my collection of postcards I've collected over the years.
Currently, cards are being kept in the repository and the page is hosted by GitHub Pages.

- `yarn install`
- `yarn start` to start development
- `yarn build` to build the app
- `yarn deploy` to build and deploy to GitHub Pages
- Can also use `npm` instead of `yarn`
