# World Through Postcards

A page to showcase my collection of postcards I've collected over the years.
Currently, cards are being kept in the repository and the page is hosted by GitHub Pages.

* `npm install`
* `npm run start` to start development
* `npm run build` to build the app
* `npm run deploy` to build and deploy to GitHub Pages
* Can also use `yarn` instead of `npm`
